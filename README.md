# Field-Goal-Bruteforce
Similar to the other field goal project that I heavily misinterpreted, this is just a bruteforce

We have only the given list of angles from 20:5:60 and the list of velocities from 10:35 as well as the delta x (86.868m) and the required height the ball needs to be at delta x (3.25m). 

This thing bruteforces the equations and adds the successful values to individual matrices and then tables and finall, it plots it.

Once again you could preallocate the size of the matrices but that is more work than I want to do and this project isnt big enough for it to matter.
